- Powershell for Mac ([instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/nl-nl/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-macos?view=powershell-7.1))

Make sure you have at least the following versions installed. This workshop has been tested with the following versions:

| Attribute            | Details |
| -------------------- | ------- |
| Dapr runtime version | v1.0.0  |
| Dapr.NET SDK version | v1.0.0  |
| Dapr CLI version     | v1.0.0  |
| Platform             | .NET 5  |

2. Clone the Github repository to a local folder on your machine:

   ```console
   git clone https://github.com/robvet/dapr-workshop.git
   ```

3. Review the source code of the different services. You can open the `src` folder in this repo in VS Code. All folders used in the assignments are specified relative to the root of the folder where you have cloned the dapr-workshop repository.

4. Deploy the Azure resources if you intend to deploy these Dapr services to Azure. Some of them can take some time to deploy, so let them deploy in the background.
   Follow the instructions in the src/Infrastructure/bicep/README.md file.

4. Go to [assignment 1](Assignment01/README.md).
