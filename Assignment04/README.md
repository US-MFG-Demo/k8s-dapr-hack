# Assignment 4 - Add Dapr state management

In this assignment, you're going to add Dapr **state management** in the TrafficControl service to store vehicle information.

## Dapr State management building block

Dapr includes APIs that support stateful, long-running services with key/value storage. Services can use these APIs to leverage a variety of popular state stores, without adding or learning a third party SDK.

Furthermore, the Dapr state management building block provides several other features that would otherwise be complicated and error-prone to build yourself:

- Distributed concurrency and data consistency
- Retry policies
- Bulk CRUD operations

The following diagram shows the high level architecture:

Right now, this is all you need to know about this building block. If you want to get more detailed information, read [introduction to the state management building block](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/state-management/).

## Assignment goals

To complete this assignment, you must reach the following goals:

- The TrafficControl service saves the state of a vehicle (`VehicleState` class) using the state management building block after vehicle entry.
- The TrafficControl service reads and updates the state of a vehicle using the state management building block after vehicle exit.
- The final solution uses Azure Cache for Redis as state store

This assignment targets the operation labeled as **number 3** in the end-state setup:

**Azure**

## DIY instructions

First open the `src` folder in this repo in VS Code. Then open the [Dapr state management documentation](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/state-management/) and start hacking away. Make sure you use the default Redis state-store component provided out of the box by Dapr.

## Step by step instructions

To get step-by-step instructions to achieve the goals, open the [step-by-step instructions](step-by-step.md).

## Next assignment

Make sure you stop all running processes and close all the terminal windows in VS Code before proceeding to the next assignment.
